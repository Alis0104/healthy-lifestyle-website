            <h3>What are the benefits of squats?</h3>
            
        	<p> “Squatting is one of the most functional movements you can do,” Tamir says. “It’s great for the health of joints, creating strength, improving posture, and requires a lot of core work.” A bodyweight squat engages your core, mobilizes your hips, knees, and ankles, and builds strength in your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. Plus, you can do a bodyweight squat anywhere.</p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes People Make When Doing Squats</h3>
        	<p>Lunging Too Far Forward
                <p>1. During lunges, it's easy to put too much stress on the knees by allowing this joint to extend past the toes. While your knee may come forward a bit, focus on taking the body down as you lunge rather than taking it forward.</p>
            <p>2.Another key point is to keep the front knee in line with your second toe throughout the lunge. It may help to tuck the hips a bit during the movement and check your form in a mirror.</p>
            <p>  Externally Rotating the Back Knee</p>
            <p> 1.Because lunges can compromise your balance, you may externally rotate the back knee in an attempt to find stability. Some people may even naturally rotate the back knee due to different biomechanics or ingrained habits they've picked up over the years.</p>
            <p> 2.Twisting the knee out or in during a lunge can lead to pain and injury. If you feel pain in the back knee, check your alignment in a mirror to make sure you're not rotating the knee in or out without being aware of it.</p>
            <p>3.The back knee should point to the floor at the bottom of the lunge.</p>
            <p> Stance Too Close or Wide</p>
            <p> 1. Each person has a different stance based on height, leg length, and what feels comfortable. However, keeping the feet too close together puts much of the force on the knees while taking them too far apart can compromise flexibility in the back leg and add to an already unstable position.</p>
            <p> 2. Check your stance by getting into a lunge position. Lower all the way down, resting the back knee on the floor (make sure you're on a mat or other padded surface). Doing this allows you to see if you have a 90-degree angle in both knees. If you don't, adjust your stance.</p>

        	<h3>How To Do Squats Properly</h3>
            
            <p>Stand in a split stance with the right foot roughly 2 to 3 feet in front of the left foot. Your torso is straight, the shoulders are back and down, your core is engaged, and your hands are resting on your hips.</p>
                <p>1.Bend the knees and lower your body until the back knee is a few inches from the floor. At the bottom of the movement, the front thigh is parallel to the ground, the back knee points toward the floor, and your weight is evenly distributed between both legs. </p>
                    <p> 2.Push back up to the starting position, keeping your weight on the heel of the front foot. </p>
